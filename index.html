        <h1> PRODUCTION:</h1>
        <img class="imatge2" src="Img/Pàgina1/production_image.jpg" alt="Stranger Things Season 2 Production">
        <p class="p1"> <strong>Stranger</strong> Things is a television-format series created by<strong> The Duffer
                Brothers</strong>. It
            was released as
            a <strong>Netflix</strong> original series on July 15, 2016. The show takes place in the fictional town of
            Hawkins, Indiana
            in the early-to-mid 1980s.
            The pilot script was brought to <strong> Dan Cohen</strong> , the vice president of production company 21
            Laps Entertainment,
            in late 2014. He showed it to producer Shawn Levy, and within days they started talking about the project
            and how to bring it to the world<br></br>Netflix was their first choice when looking for a production
            company and broadcaster as their format would give them the freedom to tell the story like an eight-hour
            movie.Originally, the show was set in Montauk and correspondingly titled <strong> Montauk </strong> because
            the twins always
            loved the idea of the coastal-town Amity feel in Jaws. As it would be impossible to shoot in Long Island
            during wintertime, production was moved from Montauk to Atlanta. The twins ended up falling in love with the
            idea that it was more Anywhere, USA, and it reminded them of their childhoods and homes, a world they
            inherently understood better than the coastal town.</p>

            <img class="imatge2" src="Img/Pàgina1/info.jpg" alt="Stranger Things Season 2 Poster">
            <p class="p2"> The title sequence was designed by production <strong>studio Imaginary Forces</strong>. The
                first phone call
                between the studio and the Duffer Brothers was set up by <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>, where the Duffers
                spoke about what
                they were looking for. Imaginary Forces was sent the script for the first episode and started working on
                the titles before the show had started filming, which is fairly unusual for a TV show. Stranger Things
                was shot on a <strong>RED Dragon camera</strong>. Aiming for a vintage film look, colorist Skip Kimball
                employed many
                tricks, including adding a layer of scanned ‘80s film grain on top.The special effects in Stranger
                Things were achieved through a combined effort of practical effects and computer-generated imagery
                <strong>(CGI)</strong>. In June 2015, it was announced that Winona Ryder and David Harbour had joined
                the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.[7] The brothers' casting director
                Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because
                of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.</p>

            <img class="imatge2" src="Img/Pàgina1/history resume.jpeg" alt="Stranger Things ">
            <p class="p1"> Set in the fictional <strong>town of Hawkins</strong>, Indiana, in November 1983, the first
                season focuses on
                the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the
                town, including the appearance of a girl with <strong>psychokinetic abilities</strong> who helps the
                missing boy's
                friends in their search. The second season, titled Stranger Things 2, is set one year later in October
                1984 and deals with the characters' attempts to return to normality and the aftermath of the events from
                the first season. <br></br>The third season, titled Stranger Things 3, is set in July 1985 and focuses
                on the
                characters growing up amidst a new threat during the Fourth of July. <strong>The Duffer
                    Brothers</strong> developed the
                series as a mix of investigative drama alongside supernatural elements portrayed with childlike
                sensibilities. They set the series in the 1980s and created an <strong>homage to the pop
                    culture</strong> of that decade.

            <p class="p2"> The Stranger Things original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the
                electronic band Survive. It makes extensive use of synthesizers in homage to 1980s artists and film
                composers including Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Goblin, John Carpenter, Giorgio
                Moroder, and Fabio Frizzi.
                <br></br>
                Another impact of the series has been an increased demand for <strong>Eggo waffles</strong>, as they are shown to be
            <strong>Eleven's favorite food</strong> in several episodes and are seen as a representation of the series. The
                Kellogg Company manufactures Eggo and had not been part of the production prior to the first season's
                release, but they recognized the market impact of the series. They provided a vintage 1980s Eggo
                television advertisement for Netflix to use in its <strong>Super Bowl LI commercial</strong>, and they intend to become
                more involved with cross-promotion. <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> will have a limited run of New Coke (introduced in
                1985) to coincide with the third season of the show, which takes place in 1985.</p>
