                    <P>
                        Stranger Things is an American science fiction horror web television series created by the
                        Duffer
                        Brothers and released by Netflix. The siblings also serve as executive producers with Shawn Levy
                        and Dan Cohen.


                        <br><br>Set in the fictional town od Hawkings, Indiana, in November 1983, the first season
                        focuses on the
                        investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around
                        the town,
                        including the appearance of a girl with psychokinetic abilities who helps the missing boy's
                        friends in
                        their search. The second season, titled Stranger Things 2, is set one year later un October 1984
                        and
                        deals with the characters' attempts to raturn to normality and the aftermath of the events from
                        the
                        first season. The third season , titled Stranger Things 3, is set in July 1985 and focuses on
                        the characters
                        growing up amidst a new threat during the Forth of July.

                        <br><br> The Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside
                        supernatural
                        elements portrayed with childlike sensibilities. They set the series in the 1980's and created
                        an
                        homage to the pop culture of that decade. Several themes and directorial aspects were inspired
                        and aesthetically
                        informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King, among others,
                        including several
                        films, anime and videogames.

                        <br><br> The first of eight episodes premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. It received critical
                        acclaim for its
                        characterization, pazing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing and homages to
                        1980's films. The
                        second season consisting of nine episodes was released on October 27, 2017. A third season
                        consisting of eight
                        episodes was released on July 4, 2019. In September 2019, the show was renewed for a fourth
                        season. The Duffer
                        Brothers have said that Stranger Things is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. The
                        series has received
                        31 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding
                        Performance by an Ensemble
                        in a Drama Series in 2016.
